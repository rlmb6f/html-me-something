                        <p>Project: Sulfatides are required for toxicity of amyloid in neurons. We hypothesize that amyloid is taken up into
                            neurons in a sulfatide and apolipoprotein E dependant manner and is accumulated into lysosomes to form oligomers of amyloid.
                             To test this hypothesis, we injected amyloid into the brain ventricles of mice or added to amyloid to cocultures of primary
                             astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Lysosomes were isolated or fluorescently stained. Shotgun Lipidomics (mass spec),
                             a technique developed by Xianlin Han, PhD and  Richard Gross, MD, PhD, is able to globally analyze the lipidome of a
                             biological sample quickly and was used to determine content of sulfatides and sphingosine, breakdown product of sulfatides.
                             The accumulation of amyloid in lysosomes and changes in apolipoprotein E were determined using fluorescent imaging, ELISA
                             and western blot. We have found that in neuronal cell culture that sulfatides increase the uptake of amyloid from the medium.  </p>

                        <p>Project: Over-activation of microglial immune responses both initiates and potentiates neurodegeneration
                            in Parkinson’s disease.  We hypothesize that paraquat exposure results in cytokine-induced NO production
                             and NADPH oxidase mediated production of superoxide that combine to form peroxynitrite in microglia.
                             To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of paraquat exposure on cytokine-induced NO
                             production (Greiss assay) in a cell culture system.  Interestingly, our data reveal that paraquat
                             actually decreases cytokine-induced NO production in this system.  Our data show that the effect of
                             paraquat on NO production is not due to decreased expression of iNOS (western blot) or to increased
                             production of peroxynitrite.  Our working hypothesis investigates increased redox cycling of paraquat
                             with iNOS as a possible mechanism underlying paraquat-induced decreases in cytokine-induced NO
                             production.    The research resulted in Miller et al. 2009 and presented at International Society for
                             Neurochemistry conference. </p>

                        <p>Project: Paraquat, a widely used herbicide, induces neurotoxicity with Parkinsonian symptoms in rodent
                            models and is hypothesized to increase susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease in humans.  We therefore
                            investigated the mechanisms underlying paraquat toxicity in neural cells.  We hypothesize that paraquat
                            toxicity involves activation of both NADPH oxidase and iNOS in neural cells and using neuronal and
                            microglial cultures to investigate this hypothesis.  In addition to decreased cell viability (MTT and
                            LDH assays) in microglia and neuronal cells exposed to paraquat, we noted activation of the enzyme
                            NADPH oxidase with subsequent generation of superoxide (DCF and DHE assay) in microglia.  Paraquat
                            induced translocation of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunit to the membrane-bound catalytic subunit
                            (cellular fractionation and western blot) in both neurons and microglia and upregulated total NADPH
                            oxidase subunits (RT-PCR) in neurons.  Addition of NADPH oxidase inhibitors was sufficient to prevent
                            the decrease in cell viability caused by exposure to paraquat.  Cytokine-induced expression of iNOS
                            (western blot) potentiated paraquat-induced increases in ROS generation (DCF assay) in microglial cells.
                              Paradoxically, paraquat also decreased cytokine-induced generation of NO (Greiss assay) while reducing
                              cell viability. Botanical compounds resveratrol and curcumin attenuated cell death in neurons and
                              microglia.</p>
